1. What is C++? What are the advantages of C++?

= > C++ is an object-oriented programming language that was introduced to overcome the jurisdictions where C was lacking. By object-oriented we mean that it works with the concept of polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, object, and class.

    Advantages of C++:
    C++ is an OOPs language that means the data is considered as objects.
    C++ is a multi-paradigm language; In simple terms, it means that we can program the logic, structure, and procedure of the program.
    Memory management is a key feature in C++ as it enables dynamic memory allocation
    It is a Mid-Level programming language which means it can develop games, desktop applications, drivers, and kernels

2. What are the different data types present in C++?

3. Define ‘std’?

=> ‘std’ is also known as Standard or it can be interpreted as a namespace. 
    The command “using namespace std” informs the compiler to add everything under the std namespace 
    and inculcate them in the global namespace. 
    This all inculcation of global namespace benefits us to use “cout” and “cin” without using “std::_operator_”.

4. What are references in C++?

=>  When a variable is described as a reference it becomes an alias of the already existing variable. 
    In simple terms, a referenced variable is another named variable of an existing variable keeping 
    in mind that changes made in the reference variable will be reflected in the already existing variable. 
    A reference variable is preceded with a ‘&’ symbol.
            int GFG = 10;
            // reference variable
            int& ref = GFG;

18. What are the various OOPs concepts in C++?

=>  i>      Classes: It is a user-defined datatype
    ii>     Objects: It is an instance of a class
    iii>    Abstraction: It is a technique of showing only necessary details
    iv>     Encapsulation: Wrapping of data in a single unit
    v>      Inheritance: The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class
    vi>     Polymorphism: Polymorphism is known as many forms of the same thing
